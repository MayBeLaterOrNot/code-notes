# Create a 404 Page with Hugo

The official recommendation is to use a layout... but I don't want to mess with styling.

This strategy creates a 404 document as a _page_, then uses Apache's `.htaccess` to point to it

## Create `/404.md`

This page will get built as `/404/index.html`

```
---
title: 404 Error
description: Page not found
hidden: true
noindex: true
---

404 Error: Page not found
```

## Create `/static/.htaccess`

This file will get copied to `/.htaccess` and point to your 404 page

```
ErrorDocument 404 /404/index.html
```
