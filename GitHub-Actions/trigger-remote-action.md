# Trigger a GitHub Action Remotely

How to get one GitHub Actions workflow to trigger another workflow in a different repository.

## Sending Action

Note: The `GH_TOKEN` is a personal access token (generated from your account settings page) that has repo-level access

```yaml

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - CHANGELOG.md

  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Trigger Remote Workflow
    steps:
      - name: ðŸš€ Trigger Remote Workflow
        run: |
          curl -L \
            -X POST \
            -H "Accept: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}" \
            -d "{\"ref\":\"main\"}" \
