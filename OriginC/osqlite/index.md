# Origin Workbook IO with SQLite

* Origin can export workbooks as SQLite databases.

* An OriginC function can import a SQlite database as workbooks.

* SQLite databases can therefore be used as a simple form of I/O between OriginLab and any programming langauge that can read and write SQLite databases.
